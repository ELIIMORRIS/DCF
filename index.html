            <p>
                Computational thinking is a combination of scientific enquiry, problem-solving, and thinking skills. 
                Before learners can use computers to solve problems, they must first understand the problem and the methods of solving them. 
                Through these elements, learners will understand the importance of data and information literacy, and they will explore aspects of collection, representation, and analysis. 
                Learners will look at how data and information links into our digital world and will provide them with essential skills for the modern, dynamic workplace.

                <ul>
                    <li>I can break down a problem to predict its outcome.</li>
                    <li>I can detect and correct mistakes which cause instructions (a solution) to fail (debug).</li>
                    <li>I can create and record verbal, written, and symbolic instructions to test ideas, e.g., the order of waking up through a diagram or flowchart.</li>
                    <li>I can change instructions to achieve a different outcome.</li>
                    <li>I can identify repetitions or loops in a sequence, e.g., identify where to shorten a set of instructions by repeating steps, for instance, when learning a new song.</li>
