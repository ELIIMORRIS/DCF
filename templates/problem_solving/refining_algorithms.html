                    <p><b>Initial Algorithm Creation</b><br>
                    Start by designing a basic algorithm to solve a given problem.<br>
                    Use <span class="fw-bold" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="A simple way of describing a set of instructions that does not have to use specific syntax i.e. can be written in plain English">pseudocode</span> 
                    or flowcharts to represent the algorithm in a clear, logical sequence of steps.<br>
                    The initial algorithm might not be the most efficient, but it's essential for setting a baseline.<br>
                    <b>Testing the Algorithm</b><br>
                    Test the algorithm using sample inputs to see how it behaves.<br>
                    Identify any issues such as errors, inefficiencies, or steps that could be optimised.<br>
                    <b>Refining the Algorithm</b><br>
                    Simplify the logic: Look for parts of the algorithm that are overly complex and try to simplify them without affecting the outcome.<br>
                    Use loops and iteration: Replace repetitive steps with loops to make the algorithm more concise and efficient.<br>
                    Optimise conditionals: Use <span class="fw-bold" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="one of two possible values (usually true and false)">Boolean values</span> to simplify decision-making processes (e.g., using if statements more effectively).<br>
                    Reorganise the sequence: Change the order of operations or combine similar steps to streamline the process.<br>
                    Handle edge cases: Ensure that the algorithm accounts for unusual or unexpected inputs.<br>
                    <b>Refining Flowcharts</b><br>
                    Make flowcharts clear and efficient: Keep the flowchart simple and easy to follow, avoiding unnecessary steps.<br>
                    Use decision diamonds effectively: Boolean values are often represented as decision diamonds in flowcharts. 
                    Make sure each decision point is clear and leads to the correct outcome.
                    Consolidate similar processes: If multiple parts of the flowchart are similar, combine them into a single decision point or process.<br>
                    <b>Documenting the Algorithm</b><br>
                    Once the algorithm is refined, document the changes and the reasons behind them.<br>
                    This documentation can be in the form of comments in the code, detailed explanations in pseudocode, or annotations on the flowchart.

                    <h5 class="text-center fw-bold" style="color: #008A55;">Loops:</h5>        
                    <p>For loop: Used when the number of iterations is known or fixed.<br>
                        While loop: Used when the loop should run as long as a specific condition is true.<br>
                        Do-while loop: Used when the loop must execute at least once, and then continue as long as the condition is true.<br>
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="text-center fw-bold" style="color: #008A55;">Boolean Values</h5>
                    <p>True/False, Yes/No: Used for decision-making in algorithms and flowcharts, e.g., in conditionals like "if X > Y".
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="text-center fw-bold" style="color: #008A55;">Formulae</h5>
                    <p>Example formula: max = max(current_max, current_value) is an algorithmic formula to find the larger of two numbers.
