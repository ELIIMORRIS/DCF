                    <u>Computational Thinking Concept: Algorithmic Thinking</u><br>
                    Algorithmic thinking involves creating a sequence of steps that lead to the correct outcome.
                    The correctness of an algorithm depends on ensuring that each statement is in the right order, 
                    just as following the exact sequence in a recipe leads to the intended result. Teaching children about this emphasizes that 
                    algorithms need a precise order to work correctly, reinforcing algorithmic thinking.<br>
                    <h5 class="fw-bold">Flow of Control: Knowing What Happens Next</h5>
                    <u>Computational Thinking Concept: Control Structures (a part of Algorithmic Thinking)</u><br>
                    In computational thinking, control structures (like sequences, conditionals, and loops) direct the flow of an algorithm. 
                    The order of statements affects whether the program follows the correct control path, such as checking the weather before deciding to go to the park. 
                    This helps students understand how conditionals and sequence impact what the algorithm does next, strengthening their grasp of control flow in computational processes.
                    Just like when you play a game and follow rules (like rolling the dice before moving your piece), in algorithms, the order of the steps controls what happens next.<br>
                    <h5 class="fw-bold">What Comes First: Steps That Depend on Each Other</h5>
                    <u>Computational Thinking Concept: Decomposition and Sequencing</u><br>
                    Decomposition breaks down a problem into individual steps, while sequencing determines their order. 
                    Just like building a Lego tower from the ground up, some steps rely on previous steps being completed correctly. 
                    Understanding dependencies reinforces the importance of sequencing and decomposition in computational thinking, as students learn to build solutions step-by-step in the correct order.<br>

                    <h5 class="fw-bold">Speed and Efficiency: Getting Things Done Faster</h5>
                    <u>Computational Thinking Concept: Efficiency in Algorithmic Thinking and Abstraction</u><br>
                    In computational thinking, efficiency relates to designing algorithms that reach a solution in the least amount of time or with the least amount of work. 
                    Abstracting an algorithm means focusing only on the essential steps to minimize redundant or unnecessary actions, like sorting homework by subject first. 
                    This connection to abstraction helps students appreciate efficiency and select the most effective order of operations.
                    Sometimes, the order of steps can help you get to the answer faster, without doing unnecessary work.<br>
                    <h5 class="fw-bold">Repeating Steps: When Things Happen Over and Over Again</h5>
                    <u>Computational Thinking Concept: Iteration (a key aspect of Algorithmic Thinking)</u><br>
                    Iteration in computational thinking involves repeating steps in a controlled way. 
                    The correct order ensures that each repetition (like a loop) processes items in a structured way without skipping or duplicating steps. 
                    When students use checklists, theyâ€™re practicing iteration by ensuring every item is handled in order. 
                    This concept solidifies their understanding of loops and repetition structures in programming and algorithms.<br>
