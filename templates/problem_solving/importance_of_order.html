        <p class="text-center">The order of statements within an <span class="fw-bold" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing a task">algorithm</span> 
            is crucial because it directly affects the logic, efficiency, and correctness of the solution. Like baking Welsh cakes or building a LEGO castle, the order of the steps is super important.</p>

                    <b>Why it matters:</b> Imagine brushing your teeth before putting the toothpaste on the brush. 
                    It doesn't work! Algorithms are the same. If steps are in the wrong order, the result won't make sense.<br>
                    <u>Computational Thinking Concept: Algorithmic Thinking</u> involves creating a sequence of steps that lead to the correct outcome.
                    The correctness of an algorithm depends on ensuring that each statement is in the right order, 
                    just as following the exact sequence in a recipe leads to the intended result.<br>
                    <h5 class="fw-bold" style="color: #008A55;">Flow of Control: Knowing What Happens Next <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-1-9"></i></h5>
                    <b>Why it matters:</b>Algorithms need to follow rules to work properly. For example, if it's raining, you wear a raincoat; 
                    if it's sunny, you wear sunglasses. This kind of decision-making is called a conditional, and it helps computers (and us!) decide what to do next.<br>
                    <b>Try this:</b><br>
                        If the light is red, stop.<br>
                        Else if the light is green, go.<br>
                        Following the rules keeps you safe, just like it keeps algorithms working!<br>

                    <b>Why it matters:</b> Some tasks can't happen until something else is done first. It's like putting on socks before shoes — socks need to go on first!<br>
                    <b>A real-world example:</b> <i class="fa-brands fa-fort-awesome"></i> Building a sandcastle:<br>
                        Fill the bucket with wet sand.<br>
                        Turn it over onto the beach.<br>
                        Lift the bucket to reveal the castle.<br>
                        <i>Mixing up the steps would ruin the castle!</i><br>

                    <b>Why it matters:</b> The best algorithms aren't just correct — they're quick and smart too. 
                    If you have a big pile of laundry, sorting it into colours first makes washing easier and faster. Computers do this all the time to save time and effort.<br>
                    <b>Example:</b> If you need to find a blue crayon in a box, is it faster to dump the crayons out and group them by colour first? That's efficiency in action!<br>
                    <u>Computational Thinking Concept: Efficiency in Algorithmic Thinking and Abstraction</u><br>
                    In computational thinking, efficiency relates to designing algorithms that reach a solution in the least amount of time or with the least amount of work.
                    Sometimes, the order of steps can help you get to the answer faster, without doing unnecessary work.<br>
                    <h5 class="fw-bold" style="color: #008A55;">Repeating Steps: Loops Make Life Easier <i class="fa-solid fa-repeat"></i></h5>
                    <b>Why it matters:</b> Sometimes algorithms need to do the same thing over and over. Iteration in computational thinking involves repeating steps in a controlled way.
                    The correct order ensures that each repetition (like a loop) processes items in a structured way without skipping or duplicating steps. 
                    When using checklists, we are practicing iteration by ensuring every item is handled in order.<br>
